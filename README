DESCRIPTION
===============================
This project creates a Chrome (Chromium) extension designed to allow customization of the "New Tab" page. There are currently several extensions in the Chrome Store that allow customization (notably, Speed Dial), but nothing exactly for what weâ€™re looking for.

Currently the New Tab page shows a thumbnail view of the most visited sites.  We have created a similar interface where the New Tab page also shows a set of links the user wants, bookmarked or not.  The extension Speed Dial does a similar thing, only it seems to have been discontinued for support, which has frustrated the community since its currently got some major performance problems. 

The languages we mainly used for this extension are JavaScript and HTML.
